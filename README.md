# AvalonApiNoDB
We created a slow API which commits to a DB every action and uses a heavy fullstack boilerplate. This is an attempt to take back control and make the application faster, as well as adding Docker support.

Original repository: https://github.com/sorensenmarius/AvalonApi
Connected Web App: https://github.com/sorensenmarius/AvalonWebAppNoDb

## Running the App
Running this app should be fairly simple. I use Docker for running it locally, but that shouldn't be required. Follow these steps:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Select the .Api project as the startup project
3. (Optional) Choose Docker from the dropdown next to the play button
4. Hit the play button
